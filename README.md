# uwrt_arm_rl
This is a project for RL training infrastructure for uwrt arm movement as part of the [UWRobotics Club](https://github.com/uwrobotics), which I collaborated with [Melvin Wang](https://github.com/uwrobotics).

The following diagram provides an overview of our project. I've also included slides for a recent presentation I gave on an overview of our project in samples/IntroToAppliedRL.pdf.

We implmented the following packages/repos for this work OpenAI Gym (Training Env) + PyBullet (Simulator) + [Stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (RL Algorithmm).

Here is a sample of our robot typing on a keyboard in simulation.
