# uwrt-armrl
This is a project for RL training infrastructure for uwrt arm movement as part of the UWRobotics club, which I collaborated with [Melvin Wang](https://github.com/uwrobotics).

The following diagram provides an overview of our project. I also worked with Melvin to develop our pipeline with traditional controls for keyboard typing, see our main UWRobotics repo [here](https://github.com/uwrobotics).

I've also included slides for a recent presentation I gave on an overview of our project in samples/IntroToAppliedRL.pdf.

We implmented the following packages/repos for this work OpenAI Gym (Training Env) + PyBullet (Simulator) + [Stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (RL Algorithmm).

Check out our 2021 SAR submission for this year's (cancelled) URC competition [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9UxN_oN-Sw).

Here is a sample of our robot typing on a keyboard in simulation!
